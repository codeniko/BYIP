Belarusian IP - update and save a dynamic IP address in a text file located on a web server around every 5 minutes through a daemon.

This was created when I went over to my home country to visit my grandmother. I setup internet in her home, left her my laptop and spent a few weeks teaching her how to use it (she has never used a computer before).

The reason behind the creation of this was to record the dynamically changing IP so that I would be able to VNC over and fix if there is ever an issue with the laptop (software wise, of course), regular maintainance (Windows OS), and introducing more control. The dynamic IP in Belarus changes extremely often and I would like to always have access to the latest one.
